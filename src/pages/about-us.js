                        Virtual Campus is an inclusive, vibrant hub of Columbia student voices designed to address the
                        need for community during the COVID-19 pandemic. <br/><br/>

                        Even though Columbia and Barnard students are now spread out all over the world, we are still a
                        community - here to support, engage, and enrich each other’s lives. In light of recent events,
                        most of the normal campus activities have been suspended, but we can still maintain our community
                        through virtual campus experiences. <br/><br/>

                        We welcome any and all creative contributions by the student body to be proudly displayed on our
                        landing page. Please feel free to shoot any of the founders a message, or submit your project
                        here.

                    <div>
                        Join us April 4-6 for a three-day design challenge to discover, design, and build solutions for
                        the
                        challenges of remote living. Being remote poses big challenges to mental health, motivation,
                        concentration,
                        and seeking help. Many of us worry about the present as well as the near and far-term
                        future.<br/><br/>

                        Students from all majors are welcome to participate. No experience necessary. We have faculty
                        and student
                        mentors to help you get your ideas off the ground. If you have an idea for an app, we can
                        connect you to
                        students eager to build things.<br/><br/>
