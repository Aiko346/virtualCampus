    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <div>
          Even though the Columbia and Barnard students are now spread out all over the world, we are still a
          community - here to support, engage, and enrich each other’s lives. In light of recent events, most of the
          normal campus activities have been suspended, but we can still maintain our community through virtual campus
          experiences.<br/><br/>

          Join us April 4-6 for a three-day design challenge to discover, design, and build solutions for the
          challenges of remote living. Being remote poses big challenges to mental health, motivation, concentration,
          and seeking help. Many of us worry about the present as well as the near and far-term future.<br/><br/>

          Let’s come together to find ways to:
          <ol>
              <li>Help students cope with social isolation (eg. fun activities, communication portals, articles,
          videos, etc) </li>
              <li>Help students continue to learn, work and live to the best of their abilities.</li>
              <li>Maintain and adapt campus activities that support the community.</li>
          </ol>

          Students from all majors are welcome to participate. No experience necessary. We have faculty and student
          mentors to help you get your ideas off the ground. If you have an idea for an app, we can connect you to
          students eager to build things.<br/><br/>
